	<p>This semester, I'll be working with the ENDEAVR organization.
	ENDEAVR stands for Envisioning the Neo-traditional Development by Embracing the Autonomous Vehicles Realm.
	It is a project lead by A&amp;M to take students and use technology to revitalize small towns.
	As part of this project, I am working with civil engineering, urban planning, architecture, and other computer science students to help use technology in order to make the city of Nolanville, TX more walkable and less car dependent.

	<h2> Hurricane Harvey </h2>
	<p>
	In my high school senior year, Hurricane Harvey came in and devastated large parts of 
	Houston, my hometown. In the aftermath, I worked with other members of my school 
	robotics team to help clean up rubble and damaged drywall from a flooded general 
	practitioner's office.
