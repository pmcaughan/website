		<h2>Machine Learning Diabetes Predictor</h2>
		<p> This uses decision tree machine learning to predict whether or not someone has diabetes given a handful of diagnostic measurements.
		This was trained and tested using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database">this public data set of Pima Indians from Kaggle</a> and had about 63% accuracy.
		I plan to try to re-implement this using a random forest, rather than a single decision tree in the future, to see if I can do better.
		This was my first real machine learning project, and the experience of learning some techniques in machine learning outside of school was a unique experience that I felt was especially valuable.

		<h2>Neural Network Digit Recognition</h2>
		<p> A basic handwritten digit recognition program written in python, made using the <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras API</a> and trained using the MNIST data set.
		This was a way to learn about the basics of implementing machine learning and a way to learn more about the internal workings of neural networks.

		<h2> This website! </h2>
		<p> This is an experiment in design, HTML, CSS, and Amazon  Web Services, and a way to have my own platform.

		<h2> Chillennium Game Jam </h2>
		<p> More an experiment in how quickly I can figure something out by myself than anything, I participated in the 2018 <a href="http://www.chillennium.com/">Chillennium Game Jam</a>, the largest student-run game jam. I had 24 hours to put together a game, and the theme of that year's jam was "Transformation".
		This was one of the most fun projects I've done, as I had zero experience making games, using the Unity engine, or using the C# language, so I had to learn as quickly as possible to make something playable.
