		<h2> This website! </h2>
		<p> This is an experiment in design, HTML, CSS, and Amazon  Web Services, and a way to have my own platform.

		<h2>Neural Network Digit Recognition</h2>
		<p> A basic handwritten digit recognition program written in python, made using the <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras API</a> and trained using the MNIST data set.
		This was a way to learn about the basics of implementing machine learning and a way to learn more about the internal workings of neural networks.

		<h2> Chillennium Game Jam </h2>
		<p> More an experiment in how quickly I can figure something out by myself than anything, I participated in the 2018 <a href="http://www.chillennium.com/">Chillennium Game Jam</a>, the largest student-run game jam. I had 24 hours to put together a game, and the theme of that year's jam was "Transformation".
		This was one of the most fun projects I've done, as I had zero experience making games, using the Unity engine, or using the C# language, so I had to learn as quickly as possible to make something playable.
