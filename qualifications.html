			<h2>Software</h2>
			<p>
			Most of my academic experience has been in <em>C++,</em>
			but most of the personal projects I've done have been in <em>Python</em>.
			I've done extensive work in <em>Java</em> during high school, as that was what
			was used in the FIRST robotics competition and during all the classes then.
			While working in the <em>Unity Game Engine</em>, I got experience working with <em>C#</em>
			which I was able to pick up fairly quickly due to it's similarity with Java.
			I've self learned a fair bit of <em>Bash</em> in order to customize my Linux
			setup, and to automate things for my classes.
			I have also done a little bit of <em>ARMv8 Assembly</em> and <em>Verilog</em> as part of my coursework.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			As evidinced by this very website, I can work in <em>HTML and CSS</em>,
			and I am proficient enough in <em>LaTeX</em>
			that I prefer it to Word or equivalent.
			</p>
			<p>
			I have experience and great interest working in and with <em>Linux</em>, I've been running Ubuntu since high school and enjoy poking around with my system.
