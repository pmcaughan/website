			<h2> About me </h2>
			<p>
				I'm currently a computer engineering student at Texas A&amp;M, where I plan to graduate in May of 2022.
				I found an interest in programming in high school competing in <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">the school's FRC Robotics team.</a> 
				I have an interest in Linux, Vim, and other open source-y goodness, and I also have an interest in politics, though I know better than to talk about my political opinions online.

			<h2> About this site </h2>
			<p>
			I started making this site as a way to learn some basic web development during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic which prevented getting an internship for professional experience that summer.
			</p>
			<p>
			I plan to put cool things I like and various thoughts here, as well as advertise myself just a little bit.
