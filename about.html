	<h1> About Me </h1>
	<div class="blurb">
	<p>
	My name is Phillip McAughan, I'm a computer engineering student at Texas A&amp;M.
	I consider myself a bit of a Linux nerd, having been using
	and tinkering with it since high school.<br>
	I am type 1 diabetic and have an interest in Machine Learning. 
	When I graduate, I hope to use my skills to create tools to help others control
	and manage disabilities, as I have personally beneitted greatly from 
	that kind of technological advancement.
	</p>
	<p>
	I am a person with a lot of random disparate interests,
	and strong opinions about things that probably don't matter much.
	Instead of using twitter where people will see me, I hope
	to use this as a bit of a platform to share some of those thoughts.

		<h2>How I Work</h2>
		<p>
		I enjoy working out of the terminal as much as I can, as I feel doing so gives me a much greater understanding of the tools I use, as well as giving me greater control over those tools.
		Throughout my academic career have tried to manage to use <a href="https://vim.org">Vim</a> for as much as I can for programming, general notes, and documents 
		(Vim, markdown, and <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> is a match made in heaven for quickly and easily making nice PDFs).
		</p>
		<p> 
		I've been a recent convert to the tiling window manager workflow, using 
		<a href = "https://awesomewm.org">the Awesome Window Manager,</a>
		learning how to use some Lua in the progress

		<h2>Some Places I Like</h2>
		<img src = "images/strongTowns.png" style="float:right">
		<h3><a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/stmedia">
				Strong Towns
		</a></h3>
		<p> I have a lot of strong opinions about urban design, city planning, and policy.
		Should you ever get stuck in traffic with me, I will talk your ear off about it, and Strong Towns' articles does a great job encapsulating some of my thoughts.
